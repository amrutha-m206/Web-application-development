      Vittala Temple is the most extravagant architectural showpiece of Hampi.
      No amount of words can explain this spectacle. The temple is built in the
      form of a sprawling campus with compound wall and gateway towers. There
      are many halls, pavilions and temples located inside this campus. Vittala,
      after whom the temple is known, is a form of lord Vishnu. This aspect of
      Vishnu was worshiped in this part of the country as their cult deity by
      the cattle herds (see Gods of Hampi). The temple was originally built in
      the 15th century AD. Many successive kings have enhanced the temple campus
      during their regimes to the present form. You can even see the remains of
      a township called Vittalapura that existed around this temple complex. The
      highlight of Vittala temple is its impressive pillared halls and the stone
      chariot. The halls are carved with an overwhelming array of sculptures on
      the giant granite pillars. The stone chariot located inside the campus is
      almost an iconic structure of Hampi. One typically accesses the campus
      through the eastern entrance tower, next to which the ticket counter is
      located. On entering through this massive tower, the first thing draws
      your attention would be a series of compact platforms along the central
      axis of the campus. At the end of these platforms stands the Stone
      Chariot. This is in fact a shrine built in the form of a temple chariot.
      An image of Garuda (the eagle god) was originally enshrined within its
      sanctum. Garuda, according to the Hindu mythology, is the vehicle of lord
      Vishnu. Thus the Garuda shrine facing the temple’s sanctum is symbolic. It
      may appear (and sometimes even referred to) as a monolithic structure. In
      reality this stone shrine was built with many giant granite blocks. The
      joints are smartly hidden in the carvings and other decorative features
      that adorn the Stone Chariot. The chariot is built on a rectangular
      platform of a feet or so high. All around this base platform is carved
      with mythical battle scenes. Though the chariot is not resting on it, the
      four giant wheels attached mimic the real life ones complete with the axis
      shafts & the brakes. A series of concentric floral motifs decorate the
      wheels. It appears from the marks on the platform, where the wheels rest,
      the wheels were free to move around the axis. You can still see the
      remains of the painting on the carvings of the chariot. Probably because
      it was relatively protected from the natural wearing elements, the
      undercarriage of the chariot spots one of the best preserved specimens of
      this kind of paintings. It is believed the whole of the Vittala Temple’s
      sculptures were once beautifully painted in similar fashion using the
      minerals as medium. In front of the chariot two elephants are positioned
      as if they are pulling the chariot. In fact these elephants where brought
      from elsewhere and positioned here at a later stage. Originally two horses
      were carved in that position. The tails and the rear legs of the horses
      can be still seen just behind these elephant sculptures. A broken stone
      ladder once gave access to the sanctum is kept between the elephants. You
      can still spot the marks on the floor and the doorsill where once the
      ladder stood
