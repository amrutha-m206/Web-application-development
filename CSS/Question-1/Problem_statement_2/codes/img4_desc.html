      The Lotus Temple is a Baháʼí House of Worship located in New Delhi, India.
      It was completed in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, it
      has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of
      Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any
      other qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing
      marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,[1]
      with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over
      34 metres[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.[2] The Lotus Temple has won
      numerous architectural awards[3][4] and has been featured in many
      newspaper and magazine articles.[5] History The architect of the Lotus
      Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla,
      California,[6] after spending some years in Canada.[7] He was approached
      in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The
      structural design was undertaken by the British firm Flint and Neill over
      the course of 18 months,[8] and the construction was done by ECC
      Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited[9][dead link] at a cost of
      $10.56 million.[10][11] The major part of the funds needed to buy this
      land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan),
      whose will stipulated that his entire life savings would go towards the
      building of the temple.[12][page needed] A portion of the construction
      budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants
      and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.[13] Rúhíyyih
      Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977
      and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986.[14] For the dedication,
      there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some
      4,000 Baháʼís from 22 states in India. The temple was opened to the public
      on 1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that day.[15]
      Worship The Baháʼí Faith states that a Baháʼí House of Worship should be a
      space for people of all religions to gather, reflect, and worship.[16]
      Anyone may enter the Lotus Temple irrespective of religious background,
      gender, or other distinctions, as is the case with all Baháʼí Houses of
      Worship.[16] The sacred writings of not only the Baháʼí Faith but also
      other religions can be read and/or chanted, regardless of language;[16] on
      the other hand, reading nonscriptural texts is forbidden, as is delivering
      sermons or lectures, or fundraising. Musical renditions of readings and
      prayers can be sung by choirs, but no musical instruments can be played
      inside. There is no set pattern for worship services, and ritualistic
      ceremonies are not permitted.[16] Structure
