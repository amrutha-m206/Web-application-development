      Kedarnath is a town and Nagar Panchayat in Rudraprayag district of
      Uttarakhand, India, known primarily for the Kedarnath Temple. It is
      approximately 86.5 kilometres from Rudraprayag, the district headquarters.
      Kedarnath is the most remote of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites.
      It is located in the Himalayas, about 3,583 m (11,755 ft) above sea level
      near the Chorabari Glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini River.
      The town is flanked by snow-capped peaks, most prominently the Kedarnath
      Mountain. The nearest road head is at Gaurikund about 16 km away. The town
      suffered extensive destruction during June 2013 from the Flash Floods
      caused by torrential rains in Uttarakhand state.[4] Etymology The name
      "Kedarnath" means "the Lord of the Field". It is derived from the Sanskrit
      words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya
      states that it is so-called because "the crop of liberation" grows
      here.[5] History Kedarnath is a pilgrimage site or tirtha dedicated to the
      Hindu deity Shiva. It is one of the four pilgrimage spots that form a part
      of the Uttarkhand Char Dham yatra or Chota Char Dham yatra.[6] The
      temple's construction is credited to the Pandava brothers mentioned in the
      Mahabharata.[7][8] However, the Mahabharata does not mention any place
      called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in
      the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as
      the place where Shiva released the holy waters of Ganga from his matted
      hair, resulting in the formation of the Ganges River.[9] According to the
      hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-Shankara-Vijaya, the 8th
      century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya died near the Kedarnath mountains;
      although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri's
      Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of
      a monument marking the purported resting place of Adi Shankaracharya are
      located at Kedarnath.[10] Kedarnath was a prominent pilgrimage centre by
      the 12th century when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the
      Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara
